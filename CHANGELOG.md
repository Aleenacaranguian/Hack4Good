## [2026-01-14] - Major Feature Updates

### 🎉 New Features

#### 1. **Recording Upload to Backend** (Care Recipient Feature)
Care recipients can now upload their voice recordings to the backend, making them accessible to their caregivers in real-time.

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/app.py` - Added `POST /recordings` endpoint (lines 262-293)
- `src/services/api.js` - Added `createRecording()` method (lines 89-97)
- `src/screens/CareRecipientHome.js` - Updated upload functionality (lines 198-314)

**What Changed:**
- **Backend (`app.py`):**
  - NEW: `POST /recordings` endpoint to create new recordings
  - Accepts: `care_recipient_id`, `shift_id`, `duration`, `audio_url`, `excluded_caregivers`
  - Returns: Created recording object with auto-generated ID and timestamp

- **API Service (`api.js`):**
  - NEW: `createRecording(recordingData)` method
  - Sends POST request to `/recordings` endpoint

- **Care Recipient Home (`CareRecipientHome.js`):**
  - OLD CODE (lines 198-248): Mock upload with Alert only - **COMMENTED OUT**
  - NEW CODE (lines 250-314):
    - Uploads recording to backend via API
    - Auto-assigns recording to current shift based on time
    - Includes privacy settings (excluded_caregivers)
    - Shows loading indicator during upload
    - Proper error handling with user feedback

**How It Works:**
1. Care recipient records a voice message
2. On upload, app determines current shift (Shift 1 if before 4 PM, Shift 2 after)
3. Creates shift ID: `{user.id}-{date}-S{shiftNumber}`
4. Sends recording data to backend
5. Caregivers can now see this recording in their views

---

#### 2. **Shift Notes Feature** (Caregiver Feature)
Caregivers can now add, view, and share notes about entire shifts (not just individual recordings).

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/app.py` - Added shift notes table and endpoints (lines 83-95, 265-343)
- `src/services/api.js` - Added shift notes methods (lines 106-142)
- `src/screens/ShiftDetail.js` - Complete overhaul with shift notes section (lines 1-311)
- `src/screens/CareRecipientDetail.js` - Made shifts touchable (lines 124-143, 182-223)

**What Changed:**
- **Backend (`app.py`):**
  - NEW TABLE: `shift_notes` with columns: id, shift_id, caregiver_id, caregiver_name, content, timestamp
  - NEW: `GET /shifts/<shift_id>/notes` - Fetch all notes for a shift
  - NEW: `POST /shifts/<shift_id>/notes` - Add a new shift note
  - NEW: `PUT /shift-notes/<note_id>` - Update a shift note
  - NEW: `DELETE /shift-notes/<note_id>` - Delete a shift note

- **API Service (`api.js`):**
  - NEW: `getShiftNotes(shiftId)` - Get notes for a shift
  - NEW: `addShiftNote(shiftId, noteData)` - Add a shift note
  - NEW: `updateShiftNote(noteId, content)` - Update a shift note
  - NEW: `deleteShiftNote(noteId)` - Delete a shift note

- **Shift Detail Screen (`ShiftDetail.js`):**
  - NEW SECTION: Shift Notes at top of screen (lines 130-187)
    - Text input for adding new shift notes
    - List of existing shift notes with caregiver names and timestamps
    - Loading states while fetching notes
    - Empty state when no notes exist
  - EXISTING: Recordings section moved below shift notes (lines 189-236)
  - UI enhancements: KeyboardAvoidingView for better keyboard handling

- **Care Recipient Detail (`CareRecipientDetail.js`):**
  - CHANGED: Shift boxes now wrapped in TouchableOpacity (line 182-223)
  - NEW: `handleShiftPress()` function to navigate to ShiftDetail (lines 124-143)
  - NEW: Arrow indicator (›) on shift boxes to show they're tappable (lines 199-201)
  - CHANGED: Label changed from "Notes:" to "Tap to view/add shift notes" (line 196)

**How It Works:**
1. Caregiver taps on any shift box in Care Recipient Detail screen
2. Opens Shift Detail screen showing:
   - Shift information (shift number, date, care recipient)
   - Input field to add new shift notes
   - List of all shift notes from all caregivers
   - All recordings for that shift (existing functionality)
3. Notes are shared in real-time across all caregivers
4. Perfect for documenting: patient mood, activities, concerns, handoff information

#### 3. **Backend Data Integration for Care Recipient Details**
Care recipient detail screen now fetches real data from the backend instead of using mock data.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/screens/CareRecipientDetail.js` - Complete data flow overhaul (lines 1-540)

**What Changed:**
- OLD: Hardcoded mock data array (lines 15-98) - **REMOVED**
- NEW:
  - State management for loading, error, and real data (lines 16-19)
  - `useEffect` hook to fetch data on mount (lines 21-24)
  - `fetchShiftsAndRecordings()` function (lines 26-85):
    - Fetches shifts from backend via `api.getShifts(recipient.id)`
    - For each recording, fetches note count via `api.getNotes(recording.id)`
    - Groups data by date
    - Sorts by most recent first
  - Loading UI with spinner (lines 151-155)
  - Error UI with retry button (lines 156-165)
  - Empty state UI (lines 166-169)
  - Proper error handling and user feedback

**How It Works:**
1. When caregiver views a care recipient's details
2. App fetches all shifts for that recipient from backend
3. For each shift, fetches recordings and their note counts
4. Groups by date and displays: "Today", "Yesterday", or formatted date
5. Shows accurate note counts on each recording badge
6. Updates automatically when new notes are added

### 🔧 Infrastructure Changes

- REMOVED: `elderly_care.db` from version control
  - Database is now generated locally on first run
  - Prevents conflicts and keeps repos clean

---

### 📚 Documentation Updates

**File:** `backend/README.md`

**ADDED:**
- Shift Notes endpoints (lines 42-46):
  - `GET /shifts/<shift_id>/notes`
  - `POST /shifts/<shift_id>/notes`

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

#### Care Recipient Detail Screen
- Shift boxes now have visual affordance (arrow icon) showing they're interactive
- Loading states with spinner for better feedback
- Error states with retry functionality
- Empty states with helpful messaging

#### Shift Detail Screen
- Two-section layout: Shift Notes at top, Recordings below
- Shift notes prominently displayed for better handoff communication
- Consistent styling with recording notes
- Keyboard handling for better mobile experience

#### Care Recipient Home Screen
- Upload button now shows loading spinner during upload

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed: Recording note counts now sync with actual backend data
- Fixed: Shift data persistence across caregiver views
- Fixed: Database file conflicts in version control
- Fixed: **Critical timezone bug in shift date assignment** - Recordings uploaded after midnight were being assigned to previous day's shift due to UTC/local timezone mismatch. Now consistently uses local timezone for both date and time calculations.

---

### 🔄 Migration Notes

#### For Existing Installations:

1. **Database Migration Required:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -c "
   import sqlite3
   conn = sqlite3.connect('elderly_care.db')
   cursor = conn.cursor()
   cursor.execute('''
       CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS shift_notes (
           id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
           shift_id TEXT NOT NULL,
           caregiver_id TEXT NOT NULL,
           caregiver_name TEXT NOT NULL,
           content TEXT NOT NULL,
           timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
           FOREIGN KEY (shift_id) REFERENCES shifts(id),
           FOREIGN KEY (caregiver_id) REFERENCES users(id)
       )
   ''')
   conn.commit()
   conn.close()
   print('shift_notes table created!')
   "
   ```

2. **Restart Backend:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **No Frontend Changes Required** - Just reload the app

### 📝 Technical Details

#### Timezone Bug Fix (January 15, 2026)

**Problem:**
Recordings uploaded after midnight local time were being assigned to the previous day's shift. For example, recordings uploaded at 00:40 AM on January 15 were assigned to shift `CR001-2026-01-14-S1`.

**Root Cause:**
Mixed timezone usage in date/time calculation:
- `today.toISOString().split('T')[0]` returned UTC date (January 14)
- `today.getHours()` returned local hour (00:40 = hour 0)

For users in timezones ahead of UTC (e.g., UTC+8), their midnight (January 15, 00:00) is still UTC afternoon (January 14, 16:00), causing the date mismatch.

**Solution:**
Changed from UTC-based date calculation to local timezone consistently:
```javascript
// OLD (BUGGY CODE):
const dateString = today.toISOString().split('T')[0]; // UTC date
const hour = today.getHours(); // Local hour

// NEW (FIXED CODE):
const year = today.getFullYear();
const month = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
const day = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
const dateString = `${year}-${month}-${day}`; // Local date
const hour = today.getHours(); // Local hour
```

Added debug logging to track date calculations during upload.

**File Changed:** `src/screens/CareRecipientHome.js` (lines 273-288)
